# ladders-app

## Running our App

For the backend, make sure you have the latest versions of `ortools` and `flask` installed with your version of python. From the root directory, open a terminal window and navigate to the `backend` directory, then run `server.py` as follows:

```
cd backend
python3 server.py
```

Now, open a new terminal window and, from the root directory, navigate to the `frontend` directory and start the React app as follows (before starting the app, don't forget to do an `npm install` if you haven't already):

```
cd frontend
npm start
```
